# Sentiment Analysis on Restaurant Reviews

This project was developed as part of the Slash Mark Internship Task 1 (Basic Level). It performs sentiment analysis on restaurant review texts using machine learning.

## 📌 Objective

To build a sentiment classifier that predicts whether a given restaurant review is **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** based on the review text.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Regular Expressions (re)
- TfidfVectorizer (Text to number conversion)
- Naive Bayes Classifier

## 📁 Files Included

- `sentiment_analysis.ipynb`: Main Colab notebook containing code and results
- `restaurant_reviews.csv`: Sample dataset (manually created)
- Output predictions and accuracy metrics

## 📊 Methodology

1. Create a dataset of restaurant reviews with labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
2. Preprocess text using lowercase conversion and punctuation removal
3. Convert text into numbers using TF-IDF
4. Train a machine learning model using Multinomial Naive Bayes
5. Test the model on sample input
6. Predict sentiment for custom reviews

## ✅ Result

- Accuracy: ~85% on test split
- Custom review prediction supported

## 📷 Screenshots (in PDF report and PPT)

- Dataset table
- Cleaned text preview
- Confusion matrix (optional)
- Test output results

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Include larger datasets (e.g., Yelp, TripAdvisor)
- Add real-time input via web form
- Extend classification to fine-grained sentiment scores (1 to 5)
